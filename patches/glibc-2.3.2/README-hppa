 One of these days I'll have a look at what they've
 got there, and incorporate their patches.]

The error

means that hppa does not yet have the proper stuff for linuxthreads.

A set of experimental patches is at
http://www.baldric.uwo.ca/~carlos/glibc-2.3.2-patches.tar.gz
but since they touch generic code, I'm not comfortable using them in general yet.
Go ahead and grab them if you want to build for hppa before hppa
support is merged into glibc.
