The directories
 2005a
 2005b
 2006
and the mailbox
 inbox.txt
contain various contributed improvements to crosstool 
that for one reason or another haven't been incorporated yet
(or perhaps they have, but I forgot to delete them from
contrib).
Soe of the patches in 200*/* were extracted from inbox.txt,
and exist in both places.
