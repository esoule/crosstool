I prefer the arm*b-*-linux* version.  The arm*b-* version can match
non-big-endian target triples such as armv4l-frob-linux-gnu (for the
hypothetical little-endian ARM linux distro from Frob, Inc.)

BTW, www.google.nl has been annoying me for ages since it shows
"Advertentie programma's" (advertising programs), but that ought to
be spelled as one word, not two.  I can understand why it's misspelled
that way, because the majority of the Dutch population simply doesn't
understand the relevant rules, and I see people messing this up
_everywhere_, even in official government correspondence.  (Imagine
the writer of your tax forms not having been able to distinguish
between there, their and they're.)
