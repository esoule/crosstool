Here are the hoops I had to jump through to get the 
gcc and glibc regression tests running on a particular
sh4-based Linux box.
Note that this recipe is highly specialized to the particular system I
am using as a test host, and will need changes for other systems.

1. The system didn't have a working rsh or rcp, so I 
installed rsh and rcp as follows:
* run 'pkg-rsh.sh' on the build system
* copy the resulting rsh.tgz file to the target system
* unpack it
* run the unpacked rsh.sh on the target system

2. Set up a chroot jail that can be logged into as follows:
* run 'pkg-chrootshell.sh' on the build system
* copy the resulting rsh.tgz file to the target system
* unpack it
* run the unpacked chrootlogin.sh on the target system

3. Since the target system doesn't have enough disk space
to hold the glibc regression tests, set up a directory on the
build system it can access via NFS:
* mkdir /jail
* /etc/init.d/portmap start
* /etc/init.d/nfs start
* echo "/jail  sh4(rw,no_root_squash)" >> /etc/exports
* /usr/sbin/exportfs -a

4. Perform other little setup tasks on the target system, in
particular, mount /jail from the build system as /jail on the target system:
* copy 'setup.sh' to the target system
* run it there
